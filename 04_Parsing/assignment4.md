Observations made for errors:

```
1. i need a flight from toronto to montreal reaching montreal early on friday

    Here the early has been tagged as an Adjective but it actually should be an adverb since it is describing to reach beginning of friday.

```
```
2. what ground transportation is available between milwaukee airport and downtown milwaukee

    Here airport is tagged as a Proper Noun but it is supposed to be just a noun.
```
```
3. show me a list of flights on july twenty second leaving dc to dallas leaving dc after 6 pm

    Here twenty is being correctly tagged as a Number but second is being as an Adjective instead of a Number.
